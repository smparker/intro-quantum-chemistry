### What's good about it

- Specific examples of how computational chemistry is used in practice
- Describes the "Philosophy of Computational Chemistry"

### What to be skeptical of

- Categories of methods are too reductive and a little outdated (for example, the author would have you believe that MD and DFT are incompatible methods, when in fact you can use DFT to run MD).
