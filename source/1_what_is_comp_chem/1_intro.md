# Scientific Computing

In this module, we will introduce the central ideas behind scientific computing and how computational chemistry fits into the world of scientific computing. In addition, we will discuss the philosophical differences between computational, theoretical, and computational approaches to chemical research. We will conclude by broadly classify the types of theories encountered in theoretical chemistry.

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to

- define scientific computing and high performance computing
- describe the philosophical differences between experimental and computational chemistry
- classify a theory as ab initio, semiempirical, or empirical
- define Big O notation for computational cost scaling
- analyze simple algorithms to find their Big O scaling
- estimate the computational time needed using Big O scaling
- log into the CWRU HPC cluster, rider
- run simple Linux commands on the rider command line
- access a graphical user interface (GUI) on rider

## Assignments

At the end of this module, you will

- complete the Linux Survival tutorial
- journey through the world of Terminus
