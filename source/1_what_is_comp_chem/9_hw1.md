## 1\. Linux Survival tutorial: Modules 1 and 2

Work through the first two modules in the interactive [Linux Survival tutorial](https://linuxsurvival.com/). These will give you a gentle introduction to the most basic commands in Linux, such as how to navigate the directory structure, copy/rename/remove files, and so on. As evidence of completion, submit screen shots of your results of [quiz 1](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-quiz-1/) and [quiz 2](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-quiz-2/).

## 2\. Explore the world of Terminus

Practice some Linux movement by playing this [command-line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html), in which you will survey your surroundings with `ls`, talk to people and read signs using the `less` command and travel to new places with the `cd` command.

To get started, read the `WelcomeLetter` by running the command

```
less WelcomeLetter
```

For a bit more structure travel to the `SpellCastingAcademy` through the `WesternForest`, attend some magic `Lessons`, and then show off your new spells in the `PracticeRoom`. Then, as evidence of your adventures, submit a screenshot of the results of the two commands `pwd` and `ls`. The final result should look like this:

```
>pwd
You are in PracticeRoom.
>ls
