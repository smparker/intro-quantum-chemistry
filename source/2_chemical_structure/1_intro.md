# Chemical Structure

In this chapter, you will be introduced to the concepts you need to know to understand how
we can computationally investigate chemical structure.
These are the tools we need to be able to answer questions like “what is the O-H bond
distance in methanol?”
or “is biphenyl planar?”

## Chapter Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to

- define the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
- define potential energy surfaces (PES)
- identify minima, transition states, and reaction intermediates from analysis of the PES
- outline the algorithm for a geometry optimization
- use Avogadro to build a 3D model for a molecule
- use TmoleX and Turbomole to optimize molecular geometry
- extract important geometrical information from a geometry optimization
- explain the need for conformer search algorithms
- outline what a conformer search algorithm does
- use the crest program to generate potential low-energy conformers for molecules


## Assignments

At the end of this chapter, you will submit a homework assignment in which you

- manually build and optimize the geometries of several compounds using TmoleX and Turbomole
- find the lowest energy conformers for several compounds using crest
