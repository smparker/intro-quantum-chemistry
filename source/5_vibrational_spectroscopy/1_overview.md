# Overview

Any method that allows bonds to be polarized can simulate infrared (IR) spectra. This includes
all first-principles methods, semiempirical models, and most standard molecular mechanics force fields.
We will focus on DFT in this chapter, but the same ideas apply to other methods as well.
By the end of this chapter you will be able to

- use simulated annealing to find global minima
- predict IR spectra using DFT
- use predicted IR spectra to assign modes to experimental peaks
