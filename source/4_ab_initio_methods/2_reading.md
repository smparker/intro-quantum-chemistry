# Chapter 4 Reading

## Required

### Wavefunction methods

- Lewars Chapter 5:
  - 5.2: "The Basic Principles of the Ab Initio Method"
  - 5.4.1: "Electron Correlation"
  - 5.4.3: "The Configuration Interaction Approach to Electron Correlation"
  
### Density Functional Theory

- Jensen Chapter 6:
  - Introduction
  - 6.2 "Kohn-Sham Theory"
  - 6.5 "Exchange-Correlation Functionals". This has a lot more detail than you will need, so focus on understanding the distinction between each type of functional family. For example, what makes something a GGA and not an LDA?
  - 6.11 "Density Functional Problems"
  - 6.12 "Final Considerations"
- Lewars Chapter 7:
  - 7.2.3.4 "The Exchange-Correlation Energy Functional"
- ["What Functional Should I Choose?" by Rappoport, Crawford, Furche, Burke (2009)](https://dft.uci.edu/pubs/RCFB08.pdf)
  
### Basis Sets

- Jensen Chapter 5
  - Introduction
  - 5.1 "Slater- and Gaussian-Type Orbitals"
  - 5.2 "Classification of Basis Sets"
  - 5.4 "Examples of Standard Basis Sets" focusing on the following examples
    - Pople-style basis sets (5.4.1) are important mainly because they are widely used. I don't recommend their use.
    - Karlsruhe-type basis sets (5.4.3) are recommended for Hartree-Fock and DFT calculations
    - Correlation consistent basis sets (5.4.5) are recommended for extrapolating to the complete basis limit with correlated methods (e.g., CC)
    - Polarization consistent basis sets (5.4.6) are good, but they were invented by Jensen so he oversells a bit
    - Property optimized basis sets (5.4.9) are recommended for good electronic properties like polarizabilities (next module)
  - 5.9 "Basis Set Extrapolation"
  - 5.12 "Effective Core Potentials"
  - 5.13 "Basis Set Superposition and Incompleteness Errors"
