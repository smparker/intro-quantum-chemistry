# Ab Initio Overview

By the end of this module, you will be able to

- use Big O notation to estimate the cost of a calculation
- explain self-consistent-field procedure
- list the principal characteristics and computational scaling of
  - Hartree-Fock (HF)
  - Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPn)
  - Coupled Cluster Theory (CC)
  - Density Functional Theory (DFT)
- define a basis
- describe what a "basis set" is and how it is different from a basis
- describe how modern basis sets are constructed
- define basis set extrapolation and explain when it is advantageous
- select appropriate basis sets or basis set sequencies for common tasks like
  - DFT energies
  - DFT properties
  - CC energies
  - CC properties

**Note:** there is a lot to cover in this chapter. Wavefunction methods and
density functional methods could each be their own course! We will focus on the
most important aspects and skip a lot of detail.
