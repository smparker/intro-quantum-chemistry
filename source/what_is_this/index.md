# What is this?

This site collects notes, videos, assignments, and labs for
the course "Computational Chemistry" taught as CHEM342/442 at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).
It is published here in case the broader community may find any of it helpful. However, the course
and materials are specialized for CWRU and therefore is provided here with no guarantee of
correctness or general applicability.

## About the course
The materials here are meant to be part of a semester-long course on computational chemistry.
It is targeted at advanced undergraduate students and junior graduate students.
As supplemental texts, I recommend

  - "Introduction to Computational Chemistry" by Frank Jensen
  - "Computational Chemistry" by Errol Lewars
