# Thermochemistry and Kinetics: Overview

In this chapter, you will learn how to compute free energies and how to use them
to predict equilibrium constants and reaction rates.

## Chapter Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to

- define a model chemistry
- explain why model chemistries are powerful
- explain the difference between energy and free energy
- describe the components of the free energy
- explain how to compute free energy corrections from the PES
- explain how transition state theory estimates rates
- explain when TST theory is expected to fail
- describe the steps required to find a transition state
- list some more advanced transition state techniques

## Assignments

At the end of the week, you will use turbomole to predict the selectivity of
a Diels-Alder reaction. You will submit the results of this investigation
as a lab report.
